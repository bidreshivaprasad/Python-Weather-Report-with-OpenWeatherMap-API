# Python-Weather-Report-with-OpenWeatherMap-API
weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. OpenWeatherMap provides access to current weather data, forecasts, and other weather-related information. Here's a short description of how you can create a weather report using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API

1.Sign up and get an API key:

Go to the OpenWeatherMap website (https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.
After signing up, you will receive an API key. This key is required to access the weather data.

2.Install the required libraries:
>>>> pip install geocoder
>>>> pip install requests

3. Make an API request:
   - Start by importing the necessary libraries:
     ```python
     import requests
     ```
   - Define the API endpoint URL and your API key:
     ```python
     url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
     api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```
   - Construct the API request URL with the parameters:
     ```python
     params = {
        "lat": latitude,
        "lon": longitude,
        "appid": api_key,
        "units": "metric"  # You can change the units to "imperial" for Fahrenheit
       }
     
     response = requests.get(url, params=params)
     ```
   - Send the API request and receive the response.

4. Process the response:
   - Check the status code of the response to ensure it was successful:
     ```python
     if response.status_code == 200:
         data = response.json()
         # Extract the required information from the 'data' dictionary
     else:
         print("Error: Failed to retrieve weather data.")
     ```
   - If the response is successful (status code 200), parse the JSON data returned by the API.
   - Extract the required weather information from the JSON response, such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, etc.

5. Display the weather report:
   - Use the extracted information to create a weather report.
   - You can print the data or format it in a more presentable way.
